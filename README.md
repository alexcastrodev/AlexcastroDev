# Motivations

Nowadays, I work developing web applications, and in the medium term, I aim to become a significant contributor to scalable systems using Java and C#.

In the long term, for example, with 15 years of experience, I want to be contributing to the academic field in operating systems and distributed systems. In up to 30 years, I hope to teach at renowned universities, inspiring young people to contribute to the field of technology and fostering the same passion I have for the history of computing.
